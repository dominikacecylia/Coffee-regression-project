# Coffee-regression-project

This Coffee Regression project analyses the coffee dataset collected through web scraping in the Web-scraping-project. The aim of the project is to predict coffee price based on details such as coffee roast, brewing method, beans processing method and 

It consists of 4 steps divided into 4 notebooks: first it cleans the gathered data and imputs missing values, it then performs exloratory data analysis identyfing trends and possible correlations in data, as well as outlires. It also uses expert knowledge to extract data features not explicitly visible in data, such as coffee beans processing stages, some of which are statistically significant. 

Data processing and modelling was divided into 4 separate files to facilitate the process and be able to work on each stage individually.

## Files navigation:
1. coffee_desk_data-cleaning.ipynb - start here to follow cleaning process
2. coffee_desk_ead.ipynb - exploratory data analysis
3. coffee_desk_data_statistical_modelling.ipynb - data modelling
4. coffee_desk_linear_regression.ipynb - data fit into linear models and its evaluation
